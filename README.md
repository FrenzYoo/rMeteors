# rMeteors
rMeteors is an event-based Minecraft plugin that brings scheduled meteor showers to your server. Admins define spawn locations, meteors land simultaneously, custom stones with health spawn on Layer Stones, holograms show HP and owners, rewards are configurable, and events are fully time-controlled.
